# LetsMakeAHalloweenGame

Here is the code for LUNA, my Commodore 64 entry to the DoubleSidedGames Halloween Competition 2019. Visit their website (https://doublesidedgames.com/) to look through their games and give them the support they deserve. 

Written in 6502 assembly using KickAssembler, this game was 95% coded in a single sitting during a 13 hour Twitch marathon stream using assets donated by my viewers. The stream can be watched through the VODs on my channel (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/499895291)

While this code is supplied for educational purposes as per the competition rules, it must be noted that its far from the best approach to doing things and certainly not the tidiest or most efficient code you will ever read. I can hopwever recommend my Twitch channel should you want to learn C64 assembly and meet others with the same goals.

## Instructions
You must guide Luna the witch through a never ending series of caves while avoiding and dispatching of enemies. As you progress Luna will fly faster and faster and the caves will get tighter and tighter. If you build up the power bar by killing enough spooky enemies you'll gain rapid fire for a short while. Destory all enemies in a wave to receive a points bonus. How far can you get??!
